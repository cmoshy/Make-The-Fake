# Time Waster

This is Time Waster. Its an attempt at a short 'RPG' style video game. As you play you will progress through a short quest chain, culminating at a final boss fight.

# Whats Playable
As of right now players can do the following:
    - move
    - light attack '1'
    - heavy attack '2'
    - interact with objects
      - herb sprite on ground
      - tree sprite in beginning zone
      - anything inherently 'alive' 
        - npc
        - enemy

    ** there are no combat animations (yet) so combat is hard to see unless you have dev console open
    ** some of the mouse click interactions are a little messed up still, you might need to move the character/mouse a bit for it to fire...
    ** player must be in 'range' of most items and entitys to interact with them -> MAKE SURE YOUR CLOSE ENOUGH TO WHAT YOUR CLICKING ON
        - visual ques for this coming soon!

# How to Play

To play, walk up to the green capsul shaped object on the screen with the bouncing 'quest' icon above its head.

IF YOU SEE A BOUNCING QUEST ICON IT MEANS YOU CAN ACCEPT A QUEST
  - click on the green capsul
  - click on the main dialogue directly
  - click exit or accept at any time or when prompted

- complete the quests
- first three are currently available

IF YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE QUEST, GO BACK TO THE GREEN 'CAPSUL' AND CLICK ON IT AGAIN
  - it should guide you to the next quest


Thank You for playing!
